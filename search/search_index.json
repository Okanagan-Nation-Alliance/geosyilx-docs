In order to create new maps you can use: The Create map listed after clicking the Add Resource button on the All Resources list page. The New button after clicking the Maps button on the menu bar. The Create map link in the Dataset Page (it creates a map using a specific dataset) The new Map will open in a Map Viewer like the one in the picture below. Using the Add dataset link, you can add a layer by clicking on one of the layers listed in the catalog. In the upper left corner the TOC button button opens the Table of Contents (TOC) of the Map. It allows to manage all the datasets associated with the map and to add new ones from the Add dataset. The TOC component makes possible to manage datasets overlap on the map by shifting their relative positions in the list (drag and drop them up or down in the list). It also allows to hide/show datasets ( show_button and hide_button ), to zoom to datasets extents ( zoom_to_dataset_extent_button ) and to manage their properties ( dataset_settings_button ). Once the map datasets have been settled it is possible to save the Map by clicking on the Save as under the Resources link in the map toolbar. Map tools and configuration In this section, we are going to explore all tools provided on the Map View page. From the list of available maps, you can select the map you are interested in and click View map, the map will look like this. The Map View (based on MapStore) provides the following tools: the Table of Contents (TOC) to manage the map contents; the Basemap Switcher to change the basemap (); the Search Bar to search by location, name and coordinates (); the Other Menu Tools which contains the link to the datasets Catalog; the Sidebar which contains, by default, the link to the Print tool and to the Measure tool; the Navigation Bar and its tools such as the Zoom tools, the 3D Navigation tool and the Get Features Info tool; the Footer Tools to manage the scale of the map, to track the mouse coordinates and change the CRS (Coordinates Reference System). A map can be configured to use a custom Map Viewer, with which the lsit of tools available in the map can be customized. Search Bar The Search Bar of the map viewer allows you to find point of interests (POIs), streets or locations by name. Lets type the name of some place then select the first record. Navigation bar The Map Viewer makes also available the Navigation bar. It is a navigation panel containing various tools that help you to explore the map such as tools for zooming, changing the extent and querying objects on the map. By default the Navigation bar shows you the zooming buttons zoom_in_button, zoom_out_button and 3d_button, other options can be explored by clicking on sidebar_expand_button which expands/collapses the toolbar.| The Navigation bar contains the following tools: The Query Objects on map allows you to get feature information through the query_objects_on_map_button button. It allows you to retrieve information about the features of some datasets by clicking them directly on the map. When clicking on map a new panel opens. That panel will show you all the information about the clicked features for each active loaded dataset. Maps Metadata Maps Metadata can be Edited by clicking the Edit Metadata link from the Map Detail page. The Map Metadata Edit form will open. Metadata provide essential information for the identification and the comprehension of the map. They also make the map more easily retrievable through the search tools. Those Metadata can be filled out through three-steps in which you have to provide all mandatory information to complete the process. Those three steps are described below. In the first step the system asks you to insert the following metadata (required fields are highlighted with red outlines): Basic Metadata Thumbnail of the map (click Edit to change it); Title of the map, which should be clear and understandable; Abstract; brief narrative summary of the content of the Map Creation/Publication/Revision Dates which define the time period that is covered by the map; Keywords, which should be chosen within the available list; Category which the map belongs to; Group which the map is linked to. Location and Licenses The following list shows what kinds of metadata you are required to enter (see also the picture below): Language of the layer; License of the dataset; Regions covered by the layers extent. Proposed extents cover the following scales: global, continental, regional, national; Data Quality statement (general explanation of the data producer\u2019s knowledge about the lineage of a dataset); Potential Restrictions on layer sharing. No further mandatory metadata are required in the next step so, once the required fields have been filled out, a green Done button will be visible in the screen. Click Next >> to go to the next step or << Back to go back to the previous step. Optional Metadata Complementary information are: Edition of the map; Purpose of the map and its objectives; Supplemental information that can provide a better understanding of the map; Maintenance frequency of the map; Spatial representation type, the method used to represent geographic information in the dataset; Users who are Responsible for the layer, its Owner, and the Author of its metadata; Related resources to link one or multiple resources to the document. These will be visible inside the Map Information panel If you miss some mandatory metadata the Completeness bar shows you a red message. Share Options In GeoNode the share options management system is indeed more complex. Administrators can choose who can do what for each map. Users can manage only the maps they own or the maps which they are authorize to manage. By default only owners can edit and manage maps, and anyone can view them. In order to modify the Map Share Options settings you can click the Share link in the Map Detail Page. Through the Share Options Settings Panel you can add or remove options for users and groups. The picture below shows an example. You can set the following options: View (allows to view the map). Download (allows to view and download the map).

The creation of a Group can be done both on the GeoNode UI and on the Admin Panel. The Create Groups link of About menu in the navigation bar allows administrators to reach the Group Creation Page. \"Placeholder for the screenshot\" Fill out all the required fields in the resulting form and click Create to create the group. The Group Details Page will open. As already mentioned above, groups can also be created from the Django-based Admin Interface of GeoNode. The Groups link of the AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION section allows to manage basic Django groups which only care about permissions. To create a GeoNode group you should take a look at the GROUPS section. Types of Groups In GeoNode users can be grouped through a Group Profile, an enhanced Django group which can be enriched with some further information such as a description, a logo, an email address, some keywords, etc. It also possible to define some Group Categories based on which those group profiles can be divided and filtered. A new Group Profile can be created as follow: click on the Group Profile + Add button fill out all the required fields (see the picture below), Group Profiles can be explicitly related to group categories click on Save to perform the creation, the new created group profile will be visible in the Group Profiles List Group Categories Group Profiles can also be related to Group Categories which represents common topics between groups. In order to add a new Group Category follow these steps: click on the Group Categories + Add group category button fill out the creation form (type name and description) Modifying Groups Through the Groups link of About menu in the navigation bar, administrators can reach the Groups List Page. For each group some summary information (such as the title, the description, the number of members and managers) are displayed near the Group Logo. Administrators can manage a group from the Group Profile Details Page which is reachable by clicking on the title of the group. As shown in the picture above, all information about the group are available on that page: the group Title; the Last Editing Date which shows a timestamp corresponding to the last editing of the group properties; the Keywords associated with the group; Permissions on the group (Public, Public(invite-only), Private); Members who join the group; Managers who manage the group. The Edit Group Details link opens the Group Profile Form through which the following properties can be changed: Title. Logo. Description. Email, to contact one or all group members. Keywords, a comma-separated list of keywords. Access, which regulates permissions: Public: any registered user can view and join a public group. Public (invite-only): only invited users can join, any registered user can view the group. Private: only invited users can join the group, registered users cannot see any details about the group, including membership. Categories, the group categories the group belongs to. Manage Group Members. the Delete this Group, click on it to delete the Group Profile. GeoNode requires you to confirm this action. the Group Activities drives you to the Group Activities Page where you can see all datasets, maps and documents associated with the group. There is also a Comments tab which shows comments on those resources. The Manage Group Members link opens the Group Members Page which shows Group Members and Group Managers. Managers can edit group details, can delete the group, can see the group activities and can manage memberships. Other Members can only see the group activities. In Public Groups, users can join the group without any approval. Other types of groups require the user to be invited by the group managers. Only group managers can Add new members. In the picture below, you can see the manager can search for users by typing their names into the User Identifiers search bar. Once found, he can add them to the group by clicking the Add Group Members button. The Assign manager role flag implies that all the users found will become managers of the group. If you want to change the role of group members after adding them, you can use the \u201cpromote\u201d button to make a member into a manager, and the \u201cdemote\u201d button to make a manager into a regular member. Group based advanced data workflow By default GeoNode is configured to make every resource suddenly available to everyone, i.e. publicly accessible even from anonymous/non-logged in users. It is actually possible to change few configuration settings in order to allow GeoNode to enable an advanced publication workflow. With the advanced workflow enabled, your resources won\u2019t be automatically published (i.e. made visible and accessible for all, contributors or simple users). For now, your item is only visible by yourself, the manager of the group to which the resource is linked (this information is filled in the metadata), the members of this group, and the GeoNode Administrators. Before being published, the resource will follow a two-stage review process, which is described below: pLACEHOLDER FOR SCREENSHOT How to enable the advanced workflow You have to tweak the GeoNode settings accordingly. Please see the details of the following GeoNode Settings: RESOURCE_PUBLISHING ADMIN_MODERATE_UPLOADS GROUP_PRIVATE_RESOURCES Summarizing, when all the options above of the Advanced Workflow are enabled, upon a new upload we will have: The \u201cunpublished\u201d resources will be hidden to anonymous users only. The registered users will be still able to access the resources (if they have the rights to do that, of course). The \u201cunpublished\u201d resources will remain hidden to users if the permission (see Admin Guide section: \u2018Manage Permissions\u2019) will be explicitly removed During the upload, whenever the advanced workflow is enabled, the owner\u2019s Groups are automatically allowed to access the resource, even if the \u201canonymous\u201d flag has been disabled. Those permissions can be removed later on During the upload, \u201cmanagers\u201d of the owner\u2019s Groups associated to the resource, are always allowed to edit the resource, the same as they are admin for that resource \u201cmanagers\u201d of the owner\u2019s Groups associated to the resource are allowed to \u201cpublish\u201d also the resources, not only to \u201capprove\u201d them Change the owner rights in case of advanced workflow is on After switching ADMIN_MODERATE_UPLOADS to True and resource is approved owner is no longer able to modify it. He will see new button on the resource detail page: Request change. After clicking this, view with short form is shown. On this view user can write short message why he want to modify the resource. This message will be sent through messaging and email system to administrators: After administrator unapprove the resource owner is again able to modify it. The group Manager approval Here, the role of the Manager of the group to which your dataset, document or map is linked is to check that the uploaded item is correct. Particularly, in the case of a dataset or a map, it consists of checking that the chosen cartographic representation and the style are fitting but also that the discretization is appropriate. The Manager must also check that the metadata are properly completed and that the mandatory information (Title, Abstract, Edition, Keywords, Category, Group, Region) are filled. If needed, the Manager can contact the contributor responsible of the dataset, document or map in order to report potential comments or request clarifications. Members of the group can also take part in the reviewing process and give some potential inputs to the responsible of the dataset, document or map. When the Manager considers that the resource is ready to be published, he should approve it. To do so, the Manager goes to the resource detail page, then opens the Edit Metadata. In the Settings tab, the manager checks the Approved box, and then updates the metadata and saves the changes: Following this approval, the GeoNode Administrators receive a notification informing them that an item is now waiting for publication The publication by the GeoNode Administrator Prior to the public release of an approved resource, the Administrator of the platform performs a final validation of the item and its metadata, notably to check that it is in line with license policies. If needed, the GeoNode Administrator can contact the Manager who has approved the resource, as well as its responsible. Once the resource is validated, the item is made public by the Administrator. It can now be viewed, accessed, and downloaded in accordance with the Permissions set by the responsible contributor. Promotion, Demotion and Removal of Group Members If the owner is a group Manager, They have permissions to edit, approve, and publish the resource. When a group member is promoted to a manager role, they gain permissions to edit, approve and publish the resource. When a group manager is demoted to a member role, they lose edit permissions of the resource and only remain with view and download permissions. When a member is removed from the group, they can nolonger access the unpublished resource anymore. Manage profiles using the admin panel So far GeoNode implements two distinct roles, that can be assigned to resources such as datasets, maps or documents: party who authored the resource party who can be contacted for acquiring knowledge about or acquisition of the resource These two profiles can be set in the GeoNode interface by accessing the metadata page and setting the Point of Contact and Metadata Author fields respectively. Is possible for an administrator to add new roles if needed, by clicking on the Add contact role button in the Base -> Contact Roles section: Clicking on the People section (see figure) will open a web for with some personal information plus a section called Users.

The Create Groups link of About menu in the navigation bar allows administrators to reach the Group Creation Page. \"Placeholder for the screenshot\" Fill out all the required fields in the resulting form and click Create to create the group. The Group Details Page will open. As already mentioned above, groups can also be created from the Django-based Admin Interface of GeoNode. The Groups link of the AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION section allows to manage basic Django groups which only care about permissions. To create a GeoNode group you should take a look at the GROUPS section. Types of Groups In GeoNode users can be grouped through a Group Profile, an enhanced Django group which can be enriched with some further information such as a description, a logo, an email address, some keywords, etc. It also possible to define some Group Categories based on which those group profiles can be divided and filtered. A new Group Profile can be created as follow: click on the Group Profile + Add button fill out all the required fields (see the picture below), Group Profiles can be explicitly related to group categories click on Save to perform the creation, the new created group profile will be visible in the Group Profiles List Group Categories Group Profiles can also be related to Group Categories which represents common topics between groups.

For each group some summary information (such as the title, the description, the number of members and managers) are displayed near the Group Logo. Administrators can manage a group from the Group Profile Details Page which is reachable by clicking on the title of the group. As shown in the picture above, all information about the group are available on that page: the group Title; the Last Editing Date which shows a timestamp corresponding to the last editing of the group properties; the Keywords associated with the group; Permissions on the group (Public, Public(invite-only), Private); Members who join the group; Managers who manage the group. The Edit Group Details link opens the Group Profile Form through which the following properties can be changed: Title. Logo. Description. Email, to contact one or all group members. Keywords, a comma-separated list of keywords. Access, which regulates permissions: Public: any registered user can view and join a public group. Public (invite-only): only invited users can join, any registered user can view the group. Private: only invited users can join the group, registered users cannot see any details about the group, including membership. Categories, the group categories the group belongs to. Manage Group Members. the Delete this Group, click on it to delete the Group Profile. GeoNode requires you to confirm this action. the Group Activities drives you to the Group Activities Page where you can see all datasets, maps and documents associated with the group. There is also a Comments tab which shows comments on those resources. The Manage Group Members link opens the Group Members Page which shows Group Members and Group Managers. Managers can edit group details, can delete the group, can see the group activities and can manage memberships. Other Members can only see the group activities. In Public Groups, users can join the group without any approval. Other types of groups require the user to be invited by the group managers. Only group managers can Add new members. In the picture below, you can see the manager can search for users by typing their names into the User Identifiers search bar. Once found, he can add them to the group by clicking the Add Group Members button. The Assign manager role flag implies that all the users found will become managers of the group. If you want to change the role of group members after adding them, you can use the \u201cpromote\u201d button to make a member into a manager, and the \u201cdemote\u201d button to make a manager into a regular member. Group based advanced data workflow By default GeoNode is configured to make every resource suddenly available to everyone, i.e. publicly accessible even from anonymous/non-logged in users. It is actually possible to change few configuration settings in order to allow GeoNode to enable an advanced publication workflow. With the advanced workflow enabled, your resources won\u2019t be automatically published (i.e. made visible and accessible for all, contributors or simple users). For now, your item is only visible by yourself, the manager of the group to which the resource is linked (this information is filled in the metadata), the members of this group, and the GeoNode Administrators. Before being published, the resource will follow a two-stage review process, which is described below: pLACEHOLDER FOR SCREENSHOT How to enable the advanced workflow You have to tweak the GeoNode settings accordingly. Please see the details of the following GeoNode Settings: RESOURCE_PUBLISHING ADMIN_MODERATE_UPLOADS GROUP_PRIVATE_RESOURCES Summarizing, when all the options above of the Advanced Workflow are enabled, upon a new upload we will have: The \u201cunpublished\u201d resources will be hidden to anonymous users only. The registered users will be still able to access the resources (if they have the rights to do that, of course). The \u201cunpublished\u201d resources will remain hidden to users if the permission (see Admin Guide section: \u2018Manage Permissions\u2019) will be explicitly removed During the upload, whenever the advanced workflow is enabled, the owner\u2019s Groups are automatically allowed to access the resource, even if the \u201canonymous\u201d flag has been disabled. Those permissions can be removed later on During the upload, \u201cmanagers\u201d of the owner\u2019s Groups associated to the resource, are always allowed to edit the resource, the same as they are admin for that resource \u201cmanagers\u201d of the owner\u2019s Groups associated to the resource are allowed to \u201cpublish\u201d also the resources, not only to \u201capprove\u201d them Change the owner rights in case of advanced workflow is on After switching ADMIN_MODERATE_UPLOADS to True and resource is approved owner is no longer able to modify it. He will see new button on the resource detail page: Request change. After clicking this, view with short form is shown. On this view user can write short message why he want to modify the resource. This message will be sent through messaging and email system to administrators: After administrator unapprove the resource owner is again able to modify it. The group Manager approval Here, the role of the Manager of the group to which your dataset, document or map is linked is to check that the uploaded item is correct. Particularly, in the case of a dataset or a map, it consists of checking that the chosen cartographic representation and the style are fitting but also that the discretization is appropriate. The Manager must also check that the metadata are properly completed and that the mandatory information (Title, Abstract, Edition, Keywords, Category, Group, Region) are filled. If needed, the Manager can contact the contributor responsible of the dataset, document or map in order to report potential comments or request clarifications. Members of the group can also take part in the reviewing process and give some potential inputs to the responsible of the dataset, document or map. When the Manager considers that the resource is ready to be published, he should approve it. To do so, the Manager goes to the resource detail page, then opens the Edit Metadata. In the Settings tab, the manager checks the Approved box, and then updates the metadata and saves the changes: Following this approval, the GeoNode Administrators receive a notification informing them that an item is now waiting for publication The publication by the GeoNode Administrator Prior to the public release of an approved resource, the Administrator of the platform performs a final validation of the item and its metadata, notably to check that it is in line with license policies. If needed, the GeoNode Administrator can contact the Manager who has approved the resource, as well as its responsible. Once the resource is validated, the item is made public by the Administrator. It can now be viewed, accessed, and downloaded in accordance with the Permissions set by the responsible contributor. Promotion, Demotion and Removal of Group Members If the owner is a group Manager, They have permissions to edit, approve, and publish the resource. When a group member is promoted to a manager role, they gain permissions to edit, approve and publish the resource. When a group manager is demoted to a member role, they lose edit permissions of the resource and only remain with view and download permissions. When a member is removed from the group, they can nolonger access the unpublished resource anymore.

The detail page has a menu item Share which is visible to people who are permitted to set permissions on a resource. The share link opens a page on the right with a provision to edit user and group permissions on the resource. see picture below The page for setting the permissions, allows addition of users/groups and selection of a permission to assign each of them.

Geo Limits permissions Geo Limits are an extension of the GeoNode standard permissions. Geo Limits allows the owner of the resource, or the administrator, to restrict users or groups to a specific geographical area, in order to limit the access to the dataset to only the portions contained within that geographic restriction, excluding data outside of it. In order to be able to set Geo Limits you must be an administrator of the system or the owner of the resource or you must have Manage Permissions rights to the resource.
