## Managing Users
In GeoSyilx, administrators can manage other users. For example, they can Add New Users through the following form.

### User Registration and Profiles


#### How to add users:
Admin users can add other users using two different methods, through the admin panel, or through the GeoSyilx UI. By default new users cannot sign up on their own.

   1. **Admin Panel Method**
   From the GeoSyilx main page, click the user bubble, and then click admin. In the admin dashboard, find the link to Users. Then on the top right corner, click add user. Using the form add the new user information, including a password, and in the second page complete the user metadata. 
      **Note**: Make sure that you add the user to the right group (ie. Fisheries, NaturalResources)

   2. **GeoSyilx UI**
   From the GeoSyilx main page, click the About button on the right of the screen. Here click Add User, to begin the processes of adding a new user.

### Editing user profiles:

##### Approving or disabling users.
   When created, new users are active by default. You can check that in the User Details Page from the Admin Panel (see the picture below).


   Active users can interact with other users and groups, can manage resources and, more in general, can take actions on the GeoNode platform.
   Untick the Active checkbox to disable the user. It will be not considered as user by the GeoNode system.


#### Resetting passwords.
   GeoNode administrators can also change/reset the password for those users who forget it. As shown in the picture below, click on this form link from the User Details Page to access the Change Password Form.
   The Change User Password Form should looks like the following one. Insert the new password two times and click on CHANGE PASSWORD.

#### Promoting a User to Staff member or superuser
   Active users have not access to admin tools. GeoNode makes available those tools only to Staff Members who have the needed permissions. Superusers are staff members with full access to admin tools (all permissions are assigned to them).

   Administrators can promote a user to Staff Member by ticking the Staff status checkbox in the User Details Page. To make some user a Superuser, the Superuser status checkbox should be ticked. See the picture below.
