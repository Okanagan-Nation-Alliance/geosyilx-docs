# Creating Dashboards

Dashboards is a MapStore tool integrated in GeoNode that provides the user with a space to add many Widgets, such as charts, maps, tables, texts and counters, and can create connections between them in order to:

    Provide an overview to better visualize a specific data context

    Interact spatially and analytically with the data by creating connections between widgets

    Perform analysis on involved data/layers

To build a new Dashboard go to Add Resource option on the All Resources page and choose option Create dashboard or select New option on the Dashboards page
